# Salesforce Einstein bot Image message

This LWC uses the [lightningsnapin base chat message](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightningsnapin-base-chat-message) to display images.

Simply add it in the snap-in as Chat Message Custom Component.

You can display images by having the bot send a message like this

image:pictureurl

to keep in line with CORS and CSP restrictions it's easiest to upload them as static resources.
